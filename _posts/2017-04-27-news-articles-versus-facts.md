## Relevancy and new articles

(edited)

I've put some thought into the current debate about "fake news" and how could society needs to balance out filtering "fake news" versus the possibility of free speech concerns, such as where large or more powerful groups could easily stamp out unwanted knowledge.

However, I'd like to focus on one aspect in this post. What exactly is "fake news" versus "true? news". Or even what is the difference between "news" and regular "facts" for that matter.

One may say that news articles must be true. Yet, there are aspects of a "news" that goes beyond mere truth. I could say that "the sky is blue," but that by itself isn't that interesting or useful for most people. I would like to define an aspect called "relevancy" to a "news article."

Not all information is relevant to every person. A statistic about a basketball player and a prediction that cars will become more expensive, one of them is clearly more useful to a basketball fan. But why not consume both sets of information? I mean we have lots of true information why don't we just consume all of information about the surrounding world that we have.

Well there are certain limitations to consumption of information. The cost of information sharing on the web maybe nearly non-existent, but the cost of time for the person reading to both digest and comprehend it is substantial.


## Importance of Summaries
Let's assume that we have world that we'd like to learn about. There's plenty of information out there, but everyone only has limited time to do certain actions. Let's say that there are n agents and they can either do an action A001 to A100 or hear about information from someone else after they already did it.

Let's say that doing any action fully takes a day(say play the guitar). While in one day you could listen to 10 people's experiences.

If any one person wanted to learn their favorite action to undergo it would take them 100 days to test all the options and figure out which one was the best. Or they could just hear 10 opionions in 10 days and quickly choose the best action to take.

Essentially, "reviewers" could create a summary about the world and then others utilizing the summary could make a faster more informed position about the world around them.

Therefore, even if all news was true, there has to be some way to figure out how relevant a piece of knowledge is to each individual person. So they can read about news that is useful to themselves.

This typically takes in the form of people flocking to their favorite newspapers/sites such as washington post, new york times, facebook pages, and reddit among others.
